        <h3>Understanding MQL to SQL Conversion</h3>
        <p>I explored why Marketing Qualified Leads (MQLs) didn’t convert to Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs). This included analyzing content engagement, persona fit, timing, and routing efficiency.</p>

        <h3>Setting SQL Goals</h3>
        <p>We aimed to increase SQLs by 10% year-over-year. This included tracking both the absolute number and the percentage change over time to measure improvements in segmentation and messaging.</p>

        <h3>Rolling Average to Understand Trends</h3>
        <p>Rolling averages helped smooth monthly fluctuations and provided a clearer view of performance patterns. This allowed us to focus on meaningful shifts without being distracted by anomalies.</p>

        <h3>Web Metrics and Engagement</h3>
        <p>I analyzed visits by country, view counts, and interactions with content. This was crucial in understanding what regions were most engaged and how to tailor strategies accordingly.</p>
